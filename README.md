## 5CCS2SEG - Major Group Project: Team Runtime Terrors



# Project
This project is called `one-day-poc`. It consists of two separate applications which interact together to provide the full functionality. The client application provides a uniform, consistent UI and makes requests to the server application. In turn, the server API responds to those requests by various means.

# Client
This project was developed for Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an Amazon Capstone Project.
The development team worked closely with Nathaniel Richard Powell and Patrick Bradshaw

# Description
This project aims to develop a system which uses GenAI to automatically generate a lightweight Proof-of-Concept (PoC) application from a user's prompt. The user is able to prompt our application with their business use cases and we generate a PoC for hands-on experimentation.

# Deployment
