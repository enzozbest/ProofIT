## 5CCS2SEG - Major Group Project: Team Runtime Terrors


# Project
This project is called `ProofIt`. ProofIt is an automatic proof-of-concept (PoC) generator based on natural language inputs. 
A user of this application is able to enter a prompt and the system will generate a PoC attempting to satisfy the user's described business needs. To this end, it makes use of Generative AI technologies. 

# Application Architecture
The application consists of two separate components: a client (frontend) and a server (backend). The server provides a stable REST API which the client can use to interact with it, whereas the client is concerned with obtaining information to send to the server for processing, and displaying received responses. The server includes an embedding microservice, which is used for similarity search in template retrieval for code generation.   


# Our Client
